For many decades, central banks throughout the world have had their independence with respect to monetary policy conditional on having to explain their policy actions, usually in formal hearings before the national legislature.
We examine monetary policy accountability hearings in the United Kingdom and the United States, leading up to and including the period of the financial crisis, and use as data the hearing transcripts for the Treasury Select Committee (in the UK) and both the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee (in the US).
This literature has sought to understand forms of communication by, for example, the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. 
The UK adopts an approach of deliberative interaction between central bankers and parliamentarians on all substantive themes, exhibiting reciprocity and minimal partisanship in the hearings. 
In contrast, the US exhibits little in the way of reciprocal dialogue between the chair of the Federal Reserve and members of Congress. 
For the US, this appears to allow greater scope to divert discussion away from the primary focus of hearings (i.e., monetary policy).
