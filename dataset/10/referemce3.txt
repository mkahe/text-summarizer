Since the widespread introduction of political economy perspectives into planning studies in the 1970 s, the understanding and conceptualization of what power is and how it is exercised has been a major topic of interest, research, and controversy in the field.
These debates were revived with the arrival of communicative planning theory in the 1990 s, and received renewed attention due to the influences of planning scholars inspired by Foucault in the 2000 s. 
Densification is the process leading to compact cities (Bokyo & Cooper, 2011). 
First, we demonstrate how including power awareness in institutional approaches in planning can provide a useful framework for the analysis of present-day challenges in planning such as fighting urban sprawl. 
Second, we illustrate how this framework can be put to work in the analysis of a densification project in the municipality of Zurich, Switzerland, in which tenants are threatened by acute housing shortages and the imminent demolition of their apartments.
