India had 11.1 million vacant housing units in 2011 comprising 12.4% of its urban housing stock.
Cities in Mexico and China also have high vacancies. 
We argue that weak contract enforcement, an acute problem in India, adversely affects housing markets.
Such a move, we estimate, would also reduce India’s housing shortage. 
This paper adds to earlier work done by Malpezzi and Tewari, who look at the relationship between state level urban vacancy rates in 1981 and rent control regulations in India. 
A lot has changed in the past few decades in housing markets in India.
In particular, vacancy rates increased from 8% in 1981 to 12% in 2011 and many states reformed their rent control laws post 1991.
Moreover, Malpezzi and Tewari report correlations and multivariate regressions, whereas we perform panel regressions.
We address possible endogeneity concerns using an instrument – distance of a district to the High Court.
Section 2 is a broad overview of the housing market in India, with a focus on rental and vacant housing.
