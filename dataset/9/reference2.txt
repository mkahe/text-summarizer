In the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA), so-called "slum-dwellers" who reside in unofficial settlements frequently suffer from subpar health outcomes, persistent housing insecurity, and social intolerance, discrimination, and racism. Additionally, they frequently live in environments that are dangerously precarious, putting their wellbeing in danger. This study examines the needs for energy and housing, transportation and mobility patterns, and challenges to their overall quality of life and health based on extensive original research with slum-dwellers from the MCMA, including focus groups (N = 18 participants), household interviews (N = 51 participants), and site visits (N = 5). Most residents of the MCMA, one of the world's largest metropolitan areas, experience "double energy vulnerability," which puts them at increased risk of both energy and transportation poverty at the same time. Our inquiry revolves around three major themes. In our investigation of the issue of extreme poverty and vulnerability, we highlight not only the issues they face but also illegal behaviors like electricity thefts and coping mechanisms. Investigating the issue of ongoing marginalization, we reveal alarming trends in prejudice, racism, and social intolerance. We investigate the issue of spatial justice and propose a set of regulations that should contribute to its realization. We conducted two focus groups with 18 urban and rural participants to examine the lived experience of energy and mobility poverty in Mexico's informal settlements. We also spoke with 51 households, visited five locations in the MCMA, and conducted site visits. Our study revealed that the majority of participants experienced "double energy vulnerability," or situations in which people faced an increased risk of both energy and transportation poverty. Furthermore, we showed that poverty experiences are not limited to affordability; rather, energy and transport poverty must be addressed through a multidimensional lens. Poverty experiences are exacerbated by peripheralization, marginalization, and discrimination. One of the most vulnerable populations in cities is the slum population, which is a particularly vulnerable group in the MCMA area. Our study has shown how housing, transportation, and energy needs are essential to their lifestyles but also a major contributor to their most pressing social struggles through in-depth field research and focus groups. Many people who live in slums spend up to half of their income on energy and transportation services, with transportation frequently constituting their largest household expense. Other instances, according to our study, showed that slum-dwellers were forced to steal electricity or cook with wood despite the risks to their health as a result of the rising cost of energy. Our research also demonstrated how slum-dwellers frequently subject themselves to substandard living arrangements and subpar service conditions, both of which may have a detrimental effect on their wellbeing. These circumstances can include being attacked or killed while traveling by public transportation or electrocuting themselves after installing diablitos to steal electricity. The ongoing marginalization of slum residents in the MCMA may serve as an uncomfortable reminder that racism, discrimination, and extreme poverty persist even in industrialized cities like Mexico City. These problems persist despite the current administration's stated priority of "helping the poor," and unsurprisingly, rather than experiencing an improvement in their living conditions, our respondents observed increased decadence, corruption, poverty, discrimination, and poorer services. This study could also serve as a reminder of the daily struggles low-income groups face to survive, as well as the frequent targets of violence and corrupt behavior that jeopardizes their ability to do so. Energy, mobility, and environmental health are not just services or extras for these communities; rather, they are crucial components of achieving better living conditions for themselves, their indigenous populations, and their future generations.
