Urbanization is an objective trend of social development and an important symbol of a country's modernization (Jain & Korzhenevych, 2020; Obi-Ani & Isiani, 2020). Rapid economic development and urbanization in developing countries have brought a large number of temporary and circular rural-urban internal migrants (Brauw, 2010; Mueller & Shariff, 2011). These temporary rural migrants often face unequal opportunities in employment, medical services, and children's education (Afridi et al., 2015; Liu, 2005; Zhang & Treiman, 2013), and they experience high social costs for families left behind, especially children (Wickramasekara, 2013). The citizenization of rural migrants (CRM) and the enjoyment of high-quality urban public services are the core of urbanization (Chu, 2020). The promotion of CRM has become an important issue for developing countries to improve urbanization and citizens' welfare. 

In many developing countries, such as Vietnam, Ethiopia, and China, rural-urban migration and the CRM face several restrictions. Moreover, the imperfection of land property rights, the insecurity of property rights and tenure, and the lack of land rental markets hinder rural-urban migration and the CRM (Selod & Shilpi, 2021). Developing countries are exploring the removal of institutional restrictions and reform of land property rights to promote rural-urban migration and CRM, such as Mexico's land certification program (de Janvry et al., 2015), Ethiopia's land registration and certification programs (de Brauw & Mueller, 2012), and China's rural land use right certification and circulation project (Li et al., 2021). 

Land reform practices in Russia, Mexico, and Peru show that land titling, the certification of land use rights, and the transferability of land facilitate migration (Chernina et al., 2014; de Janvry et al., 2015; Field, 2007). However, some studies suggest that land titling and land transferability have no significant positive effect on CRM (Daymard, 2022; de Brauw & Mueller, 2012; Li et al., 2021). China operates an urban-rural dual land system related to the hukou system (Zhou et al., 2020). The hukou system, which categorises citizens into urban (non-agricultural) and rural (agricultural) residents of a particular location, is a unique household registration management system (Afridi et al., 2015; Bosker et al., 2012). It is considered an institution of citizenship in China where rural migrants transfer agricultural hukou from their hometowns to destination cities (TransferHK). The hukou system is a necessary bridge for CRM. Some studies have shown that the relaxation of restrictions on TransferHK, the certification of rural land use rights, and the transferability of agricultural land in China have not promoted CRM as expected (Li et al., 2021; Tao et al., 2015; Zhu, 2007). 

To better promote urbanization, China's National Development and Reform Commission put forward the National New-type Urbanization Plan (2014â€“2020) in March 2014 (Wang et al., 2015). One of its goals is to promote CRM through the hukou system reform and rural land marketization. Recent hukou system reforms together with rural land marketization in China's new urbanization plan are fundamentally changing the nature of rural property rights, eroding hukou-based rights and introducing market-based rights (Andreas & Zhan, 2016; Chen et al., 2020). This paper focuses on three questions: First, what is the effect of relaxing hukou restrictions on CRM? Second, what is the effect of land marketization on CRM? Third, how can the positive effects (if any) of these policies on CRM be enhanced? The findings may provide a reference for developing countries in the relaxation of migration restrictions and land system reforms in the process of urbanization, especially in countries where land is state-owned or collectively owned. 

A literature review is presented in Section 2. A review of the institutional background of China's rural land rights, the new urbanization, hukou system reform and rural land marketization are presented in Section 3. Theoretical framework and hypotheses are in Section 4. The methodology, data and variables are described in Section 5 and Section 6 respectively. Section 7 shows the estimated effects of rural land rights, hukou system reform and rural land marketization and the moderating effects on TransferHK. The conclusions, policy implications and limitations are discussed in Section 8.
