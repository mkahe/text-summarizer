Over 2018 and 2019, a lengthy El Nino drought unfolded in the Philippines and disrupted regular patterns of rainfall across the archipelago.
While by no means the most serious event in recent history, especially relative to the particularly disastrous 1997/8 El Nino, the length and impact of the drought on the capital of Manila meant that the event received disproportionate attention from politicians and national media.
The state of calamity was deemed so severe that the Archbishop of Cebu issued an Oratio Imperata, or obligatory prayer, that implored Church-goers at Sunday mass to request that God “Shower us with rain, provide us with water that we need.”, in what has become a traditional part of contemporary mass during El Nino events in the Philippines.
This moment is important, as it not only highlights the significance of climate and climate change in Philippine society but emphasises that “climate” is understood and acted on in many nations beyond Euro-American political and scientific rationalities that a scientific and progressive left against a retrograde right-wing and populist movements that thrive on climate change denial. 
And what heightens the significance of this particular El Nino event is that it took place during the administration of the populist President Rodrigo Duterte, elected in 2016, whose responses to the ensuing water crisis seamlessly blended with the president’s violent and authoritarian techniques of government.
In response, the Philippine state has developed over the last two decades perhaps the world’s most comprehensive climate change response policy infrastructure. 
Scholars have therefore increasingly looked to the experiences of peoples most violently impacted by climate change, yet rarely “take seriously” experiences from places like the Philippines nor the actions of powerful but ethically unsavoury actors such as Duterte who challenge both liberal-humanist norms of climate action and ascendant posthumanist critiques. 
I do so by examining the Philippine state’s responses to the 2018–2019 El Nino event.
Before Duterte’s election, successive presidential administrations in the Philippines have enthusiastically embraced the global governance of climate change through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and other multilateral arrangements to facilitate national adaptation and support mitigation efforts. 
However, in 2016 the nation elected the internationally controversial and provocative populist Rodrigo Duterte in what the Philippine national media and foreign commentators saw as a harsh rebuke, proximately, of the liberalism of the previous Benigno Aquino III administration and ultimately of the social and economic failures of the post-Marcos era.
n contrast to the Aquino government’s overt embrace of multilateralism and neoliberalism as the path to prosperity, Duterte has sought to personally champion adaptation to climate change, exemplified in his responses to the 2018–2019 El Nino, through a jarring combination of practices: exhorting the devastating reality of climate change for developing nations; denigrating multilateral mitigation efforts as colonial injustices; subverting indigenous peoples’ land rights; and fostering extrajudicial assassination of activists opposed to water securitization projects.
Finally, I examine the recent responses of the Duterte administration, particularly Duterte’s extralegislative actions, to the recent 2018–2019 El-Nino-driven water crisis as a concrete and confronting example of adaptation to climate change.
As such, the paper augments a close examination of the existing historical and policy literature surrounding climate and climate change governance in the Philippines with a review of: the Philippine news media focused on the Duterte’s administration, spanning climate change and the Kaliwa Dam project and as well the Philippine and international media coverage of climate change policies and responses by previous administrations since the early 2000s; and, the policy documentation from key state organisations relevant to the Kaliwa Dam project (e.g., MWSS and NCIP) since Duterte’s election in 2016.
